# Thumbnail image

Thumbnail is an image used to present template to the users in the template selection menu. This image has to be in SVG format and 170 pixels wide by 130 pixels tall. Images bigger or smaller than this will be scaled.

As opposed to [preview image](preview.markdown) these images can not use system defined classes.
